# Pet Shop

The goal of this challenge is to implement an inventory system for a pet shop in Rails.

## Guidelines

* For every milestone completed, commit it to your version control system.

* Inform your mentor when you have completed a milestone, so they can check your work and give appropriate feedback.

* If you are having difficulty with the task, don't hesitate to consult your mentor, or any of the devs.

* Even though the examples given lack design, feel free to design your page to your liking.

* You are free to use any gems or libraries in your implementation.

## Milestones

There are multiple milestones to this challenge, each building on top of the output from the previous milestone.

### Milestone 1 - Base Functionality

Implement the basic functionality of the inventory system.

Here are the user stories for the basic requirements:

* As a user, I can add a new animal into my inventory and specify its species, breed, and price.

* As a user, I can edit any previously added animal in my inventory, and update their species, breed, or price.

* As a user, I can mark any previously added animal in my inventory as sold.

* As a user, I can remove any previously added animal in my inventory.

I have included a rudimentary example of this milestone [here](https://github.com/b-ggs/indinero-intern-challenges/blob/master/pet-shop/pet-shop.html).

### Milestone 2 - Inventory Summary

Create a separate page where I can see a summary of the contents of my inventory.

Here are the user stories for the summary page:

* As a user, I can view the number of animals of every species I have for sale.

* As a user, I can view the number of animals of every species I have sold.

* As a user, I can view the total amount I have earned from every animal sold.

For example:

```
For sale:
Number of Dogs: 3
Number of Cats: 3

Sold:
Number of Dogs: 1
Number of Cats: 0

Total Amount Received From Sales: P10,000
```

### Milestone 3 - Inventory Filters

In your inventory page, introduce a way to filter the animals by their species, breed, and status (sold or not sold).

Bonus points if you add price range to the filters!

Here are the user stories for the filters:

* As a user, I can filter the inventory by species. (ex. I only want to see dogs in the list.)

* As a user, I can filter the inventory by breed. (ex. I only want to see Shih Tzus in the list.)

* As a user, I can filter the inventory by whether it is sold or not. (ex. I only want to see the animals that have been sold.)

* (Bonus!) As a user, I can filter the inventory by price. (ex. I only want to see animals priced between P10,000 and P20,000.)

### Milestone 4 - User Login

Since you wouldn't want any other people to see your inventory, implement a login page so only you can log into your infentory.

Here are the user stories for the login system:

* As a user, I can log in to the system with a valid username and password.

* As a user, I cannot see the inventory list if I am not logged into the system.

* As a user, I can log out of the system if I have previously logged into the system.
